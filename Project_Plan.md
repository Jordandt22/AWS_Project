# Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

## 1. Requirements Analysis

- Determine the technological and business needs.
- Describe the requirements for scalability and performance.
- Evaluate the needs for security and compliance.
- Get feedback from Stakeholders

## 2. Determining Software Architecture

- Describe the microservices and system components.
- Develop storage solutions and database schemas.
- Plan how to integrate APIs and other services.
- Create a plan for cloud deployment.

## 3. Developing the software 

- Implement backend services (compute, storage, networking).
- Create monitoring and logging solutions.
- Develop security features (authentication, encryption, access control).

## 4. Testing the system

- Conduct both integration and unit testing.
- Perform stress and load tests.

## 5. Deployment & Maintenance

- Deploy software to production environments.
- Track the performance and health of the system.
- Implement updates, bug fixes, and improvements.
